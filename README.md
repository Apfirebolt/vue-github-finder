# Github User Finder App - Vue JS and Vuesax ⚡️

## Project Briefing

Inspired by the Github Finder app written by Brad Traversy in React. This is the Vue version of the app with pretty much the same features as the one created by Brad here [Github Finder by Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy/github-finder). This uses Vuesax UI library in Vue for UI components.
